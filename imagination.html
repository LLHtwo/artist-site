                <h3 class="modal-section-title">Story</h3>
                <p class="modal-note">By the time I put this one together, life looked really different from when I made
                    <em>Make Me Feel Alright</em>. I was more settled in, had a friend group, knew people from house
                    parties and park evenings, and felt way more comfortable in my environment. Funny enough, I actually
                    got along better with the girls in my grade than the guys, but either way, I finally felt like I
                    belonged somewhere. Still, I had those nights where everything caught up with me and I just needed
                    music as therapy again.</p>
                <p class="modal-note">This album started as another collection of songs, but this time I knew I wanted
                    it to become a project. Once I had seven tracks, I said, “alright, that’s the album,” and locked it
                    in. Interestingly, the first song I wrote for it was <em>Record Deals</em>, which ended up as the
                    last track on the final version. The overall mood wasn’t super different from the first album; still
                    personal, still me working through those late-night emotions, but I definitely wanted to make it
                    sound a bit more “normal,” a little closer to mainstream pop than my first one.</p>

                <h3 class="modal-section-title">The Quick Infatuation Swap</h3>
                <p class="modal-note">One of the biggest last-minute moves I made was with <em>Quick Infatuation</em>.
                    Originally it was a completely different song with a totally different production. The problem was:
                    the key sat right in the dead spot of my vocal range, so no matter how I sang it, it didn’t work,
                    and when I tried to change the key, it didn’t sound right anymore. Instead of pushing through, I
                    panicked because I’d already set myself a release date for August 1st, so I scrapped the original
                    version and built a new song from scratch only two weeks before release. I’ve regretted it ever
                    since. The lyrics weren’t fleshed out, and it just doesn’t hit the way the original did. At some
                    point, I’ll definitely drop the real <em>Quick Infatuation</em> on like a “The Vault” release,
                    because that version was really good.</p>

                <h3 class="modal-section-title">Writing &amp; Themes</h3>
                <p class="modal-note">Like the first album, this one was therapy for me. Most songs tie back to real
                    events or people, the title track <em>Imagination</em> especially, which I wrote about a girl I
                    wasn’t sure was into me. In my head, I thought dropping the song would make her come up to me and
                    say, “yeah, I like you too.” Spoiler: that never happened. But at the time, it felt like I was
                    shooting my shot in my own way. The rest of the album was me trying to balance that deeply personal
                    writing with the idea of making music that felt more accessible.</p>

                <h3 class="modal-section-title">Production</h3>
                <p class="modal-note">Sound-wise, it’s pretty close to <em>Make Me Feel Alright</em> because I started
                    it almost immediately after finishing that one. I still used Logic with loops as a base, leaned on
                    reverb, and aimed for atmosphere. But I did learn from the first project, so the production here is
                    at least a little tighter. I still used the mastering assistant, but I tried to do more proper
                    mixing. Overall, though, both albums live in the same universe – which makes sense, since they’re
                    only about four months apart. One influence that snuck in was Avicii. <em>Record Deals</em> was
                    basically my “what if I made something like <em>Levels</em>” experiment. It didn’t end up being the
                    next <em>Levels</em> (thanks to me not doing any marketing for the album), but at least the ambition
                    was there.</p>

                <h3 class="modal-section-title">Looking Back</h3>
                <p class="modal-note">I don’t think <em>Imagination</em> is as strong as <em>Make Me Feel Alright</em>.
                    It’s less cohesive and feels more like seven different songs and genres mashed together, even more
                    than MMFA. But I think you can still hear the progression, the mixing’s a bit better, the production
                    more confident, and it shows I was starting to think about what kind of artist I wanted to be. If I
                    could fix one thing, it’d definitely be the mix and master, like in <em>Make Me Feel Alright</em>.
                    Still, for all its flaws, it’s part of my story, and it shows that hunger to just keep going, keep
                    releasing, and keep figuring myself out.</p>
