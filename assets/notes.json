I had a couple songs already lying around – *Liftoff* and *Lucky Break* started as instrumentals I just put up onto YouTube for fun. At some point I thought, “why not throw some lyrics over these?” and that was basically the spark. From there, whenever I felt like crap, usually late at night, I just opened up Logic and spit out whatever was in my head. At the time, I was in a pretty weird spot in life: stuck in the last part of school, just had to repeat a year, didn’t know that many people in my new class. Music ended up being where I poured all of that."

There wasn’t a grand plan or a concept, it was just me making songs whenever I felt like I had to, and then realizing at some point that they actually worked together as an album."

I leaned hard on reverb and arpeggiators, which gave the whole project this space-y, 80s kind of vibe. Around then, I was listening to a lot of Grimes, and while I wasn’t copying her, the way she used arps definitely lined up with what I was doing. Honestly, using arps just made it easier to build melodies that felt alive. The sound is definitely rough around the edges sometimes, but I think that’s also what gives it character."

If there’s one thing I’d change though, it would be the mix and mastering. Back then, I just threw Logic’s built-in mastering assistant on everything and called it a day. But even with the roughness, I think it holds up. *Liftoff* especially still feels like such a strong opener that I’ve even thought about doing something more with it. As a first album, it couldn’t have been a better starting point: maybe a bit unpolished, but honest, and definitely the beginning of everything I’ve built since."

Funny enough, I actually got along better with the girls in my grade than the guys, but either way, I finally felt like I belonged somewhere. Still, I had those nights where everything caught up with me and I just needed music as therapy again.\n\nThis album started as another collection of songs, but this time I knew I wanted it to become a project. Once I had seven tracks, I said, “alright, that’s the album,” and locked it in. Interestingly, the first song I wrote for it was *Record Deals*, which ended up as the last track on the final version. The overall mood wasn’t super different from the first album; still personal, still me working through those late-night emotions, but I definitely wanted to make it sound a bit more “normal,” a little closer to mainstream pop than my first one."

The problem was: the key sat right in the dead spot of my vocal range, so no matter how I sang it, it didn’t work, and when I tried to change the key, it didn’t sound right anymore. Instead of pushing through, I panicked because I’d already set myself a release date for August 1st, so I scrapped the original version and built a new song from scratch only two weeks before release. I’ve regretted it ever since. The lyrics weren’t fleshed out, and it just doesn’t hit the way the original did. At some point, I’ll definitely drop the real *Quick Infatuation* on like a “The Vault” release, because that version was really good."

In my head, I thought dropping the song would make her come up to me and say, “yeah, I like you too.” Spoiler: that never happened. But at the time, it felt like I was shooting my shot in my own way. The rest of the album was me trying to balance that deeply personal writing with the idea of making music that felt more accessible."

I still used Logic with loops as a base, leaned on reverb, and aimed for atmosphere. But I did learn from the first project, so the production here is at least a little tighter. I still used the mastering assistant, but I tried to do more proper mixing. Overall, though, both albums live in the same universe – which makes sense, since they’re only about four months apart. One influence that snuck in was Avicii. *Record Deals* was basically my “what if I made something like *Levels*” experiment. It didn’t end up being the next *Levels* (thanks to me not doing any marketing for the album), but at least the ambition was there."

But I think you can still hear the progression, the mixing’s a bit better, the production more confident, and it shows I was starting to think about what kind of artist I wanted to be. If I could fix one thing, it’d definitely be the mix and master, like in *Make Me Feel Alright* . Still, for all its flaws, it’s part of my story, and it shows that hunger to just keep going, keep releasing, and keep figuring myself out"

Then I tried out Ozone 11 for the first time, and honestly, it saved the song. Ozone pulled everything together, smoothed out the harshness, and made it sound like a real, finished record.

That’s how this whole project was born: an electronic, wordless album.\n\nI’d always liked house and techno, but I never really nailed the sound before. With *Spacewalk*, I finally felt like I was figuring it out, making tracks that actually sounded how I wanted them to. At first, it wasn’t a concept album at all, just a bunch of electronic songs.

Then, something goes wrong in *Breach*, the mission collapses and communication breaks down. Lost Signal then has the vibe of being stranded in space, everyone else millions of miles away. Finally, *Detach* closes it all with sacrifice: one person letting go, so the other can survive.\n\nIt’s a narrative, but the songs also stand on their own.

I had this idea of a really emotional, interstellar-like ending, but I just couldn’t make it sound right. It took a while to get there, but once I did, everything clicked.\n\nOverall, I was really pushing myself to make something that felt big and cinematic.

At that point, I wasn’t setting out to write a rap album or a concept piece, I was just experimenting. But as the tracks piled up, the idea of a narrative took hold. Originally, I thought the story would follow an egomaniac who gradually learns humility and ends up grounded. But it didn’t really work and felt forced. So, I flipped it: instead of redemption, the arc became one of rise and collapse. Fourteen tracks charting the journey from innocent ambition, through success and ego, into temptation and unraveling. At first, I tried sticking to my old “seven songs per album” rule, but seven wasn’t nearly enough for the story. Doubling it gave me plenty of room to let the arc develop. Some tracks existed before the concept (*Project 1*, *Glory*, *Go Away*), while others were built to fill specific roles (*Famous* as the intro, *Bye Bye* as the breakout, *Orbit* as the pause).

It captures the peak of the journey, one perfect day where everything clicks. But even there, cracks appear. The bridge hints that the dream won’t last, setting up the collapse that follows.

Beyond that, I also let songs lean into their own world: *Little Leak* with east coast 90s production, *Temptation* channeling The Prodigy’s abrasive electronic energy, *Project 1* with those Yeezus-like synths. My process was mostly beat-first, lyrics-after. Once I had the structure, I didn’t reshuffle songs much, they just locked into place naturally. The hardest to finish was probably *October*, the drum loop has a really loud cymbal that actually made me go insane. But once the mix came together, it became one of my favorite songs on the album.
