# My Artist Website

This project is a personal website showcasing my work as an artist. It includes sections for albums, a featured release, and links to social platforms.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The development server (powered by [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)) now serves files from the repository root.

## Project Structure

CNAME          # custom domain (must remain in the repository root)
```

## Custom Domain

GitHub Pages uses the `CNAME` file to configure a custom domain. Keep this file at the repository root so your domain continues to work.
