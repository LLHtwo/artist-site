        <h3 class="section-subtitle">Quick Overview</h3>

        <p class="muted">I’m LLH, an artist and producer from Germany making music that blends rap, electronic, and
          experimental sounds into personal stories. My songs are equal parts therapy and exploration — sometimes raw
          and vulnerable, sometimes bold and ambitious. Each release builds its own world, but the thread running
          through everything is honesty and the search for meaning.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">Full Story</h3>

        <p>Music has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I started piano lessons at the age of five
          and sang in choirs as a kid — even doing solos in front of thousands of people. At first it was all about
          composition, recording little piano pieces and experimenting with sound, but over time that curiosity evolved
          into producing. I spent years just making instrumental tracks for myself, and only with my first album, "Make
          Me Feel Alright", did I fully step into writing lyrics and shaping complete songs.</p>

        <p>For me, music has always been more than just a hobby — it’s therapy, self-expression, and a way to process
          life. In the early days, I mostly wrote when I was feeling low, late at night, using Logic as a safe place to
          throw down ideas and emotions. That’s why my earliest songs carry so much rawness and vulnerability. Over time
          I learned to make music simply for the joy of it too, but I still fall back on it whenever I need to cope.
          That balance between fun and catharsis is at the heart of everything I create.</p>

        <p>I grew up in a very privileged background — upper-class, never having to worry about basics — but with that
          came its own challenges. Self-confidence didn’t come naturally to me, and sometimes I still catch myself
          doubting my place, in music, or in life. I think that tension seeps into the songs: they’re honest, they
          question things, they carry both confidence and fragility. My parents did a good job of keeping me grounded
          despite the privilege, and I try to stay aware of where I come from while building something on my own terms.
        </p>

        <p>My sound doesn’t really fit into one box. It leans electronic because I produce entirely on a computer, but
          my influences are all over the map. I grew up listening to everything from Grimes to Kanye to Rammstein, and
          I’ll pull from any genre if the vibe feels right. That’s why each album has its own fingerprint: "Make Me Feel
          Alright" was hazy and raw, "I"magination" was more experimental, "Spacewalk" turned into a cinematic, wordless
          journey, and "Born For More" became my first real concept album — a full narrative arc about ambition, fame,
          and collapse.</p>

        <p>What ties it all together is storytelling. I don’t lock myself into a single genre, but I always chase a
          story or feeling that demands to be told. Sometimes that story is personal, sometimes it’s fictional, but it
          always connects back to the emotions I’ve lived through. At the end of the day, my biggest goal is simple: I
          want someone, somewhere, to tell me that one of my songs changed their life. That’s the impact I’m chasing —
          to make something that actually matters.</p>

        <p>If you’re new to my music, I guess a few good entry points are "Liftoff" from my debut album "Make Me Feel
          Alright", which captures the raw beginning; "Break It Down" if you want to hear more of the electronic side;
          or "Famous" and "Silver Lining" from the upcoming "Born For More", which showcase the rap and storytelling
          approach I’ve been developing. Each release is a piece of my journey, and together they tell the story of
          where I’ve been — and where I’m heading.</p>
