          I’m LLH, a 20-year-old artist from Germany whose music crosses rap, house, techno, and experimental
          electronic.
          What began as a way to process late nights and stray feelings has grown into a series of albums,
          each with its own sound and story. At the core of everything I make is honesty — whether raw and unfiltered or
          carefully built,
          my songs are snapshots of where I’ve been and where I’m heading.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">Full Story</h3>

        <p>
          Music has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. I started piano lessons at the age of five and
          grew up singing in choirs,
          even stepping out front for solos in front of thousands of people. Back then it was about the thrill of
          performance and the beauty of
          composition — recording small piano pieces, experimenting with chords and melodies, and slowly realizing that
          sound itself could be a language.
          That curiosity eventually pulled me deeper into production, where I could sculpt entire soundscapes on a
          laptop.
        </p>

        <p>
          For years, I created purely instrumentals. They were private, almost like sketchbooks — places where I could
          play, explore,
          and figure out what I was trying to say without actually using words. That changed with my debut album
          <em>Make Me Feel Alright</em>, when I began writing lyrics and stepping fully into the role of a songwriter.
          The project wasn’t planned as a “career move” — it came out of nights where I felt low, alone, and in need of
          an outlet.
          Logic became my safe space: a blank canvas where I could unload everything in my head.
          That’s why those early tracks are so raw, vulnerable, and unpolished. They weren’t made to impress; they were
          made to survive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, I’ve learned to balance that need for catharsis with the joy of creation.
          Some songs still come from a place of processing — heartbreak, self-doubt, or frustration —
          while others exist just because it feels good to make them. That tension between heaviness and fun, fragility
          and confidence,
          runs through everything I release. It reflects my own life: I grew up in a privileged background where I never
          had to worry
          about material needs, yet self-confidence never came naturally to me. That paradox shows up in the music:
          songs that sound bold
          on the surface but carry a quieter uncertainty underneath.
        </p>

        <p>
          My sound doesn’t sit in one box. I lean electronic because I work entirely on a computer,
          but my influences are scattered — from Grimes’ dreamy experimentation to Kanye’s ambition,
          from the aggression of Rammstein to the intimacy of singer-songwriters. I’ll borrow from anywhere if the
          feeling matches.
          That’s why each album has its own fingerprint. <em>Make Me Feel Alright</em> was hazy and unfiltered,
          <em>Imagination</em> leaned into experimentation, <em>Spacewalk</em> became a cinematic, wordless journey
          through sound,
          and <em>Born For More</em> is my most ambitious project yet: a full concept album telling the rise-and-fall
          story
          of ambition, fame, and collapse.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the center of it all is storytelling. I don’t set out to make songs that fit neatly into a genre;
          I follow stories and emotions that demand to be told. Sometimes those stories are autobiographical, sometimes
          fictional,
          but they’re always rooted in something I’ve lived or felt. For me, the real measure of success isn’t streams
          or charts —
          it’s hearing that one of my songs helped someone, shifted their perspective, or made them feel less alone.
          That’s the impact I’m chasing: to make music that matters.
        </p>


        <p>
          New here? A few good starting points:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>“Liftoff”</strong> from <em>Make Me Feel Alright</em> — where the raw beginning lives.</li>
          <li><strong>“Break It Down”</strong> — a window into the electronic side.</li>
          <li><strong>“Famous”</strong> and <strong>“Silver Lining”</strong> from <em>Born For More</em> — rap-forward,
            narrative-driven highlights.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each release is a chapter; each track, a page. Together they tell the story of where I’ve been—and where I’m
          heading.
