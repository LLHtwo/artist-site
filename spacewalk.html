            <div class="modal-body">
                <h3 class="modal-section-title">Story</h3>
                <p class="modal-note">By the time I started <em>Spacewalk</em>, life had shifted again. In September
                    2024 I moved out to study in another city, into a shared apartment. The walls were thin, and singing
                    felt awkward because I knew everyone could hear me, so I leaned into instrumentals instead. That’s
                    how this whole project was born: an electronic, wordless album.</p>
                <p class="modal-note">I’d always liked house and techno, but I never really nailed the sound before.
                    With <em>Spacewalk</em>, I finally felt like I was figuring it out, making tracks that actually
                    sounded how I wanted them to. At first, it wasn’t a concept album at all, just a bunch of electronic
                    songs. But when I started naming them, I realized they could fit into a bigger arc. That’s when the
                    idea of making it a kind of <em>Interstellar</em>-inspired journey developed.</p>

                <h3 class="modal-section-title">Writing &amp; Themes</h3>
                <p class="modal-note">The album tells the story of a space mission. It starts with wonder and discovery,
                    but gradually shifts into chaos and loss. <em>Nocturne</em> and <em>Mirage</em> are wide-eyed,
                    gazing out into the stars. <em>Spacewalk</em> is a bit more dynamic, in a movie this track would be
                    played over like a montage or something. <em>Disturbance</em> sprinkles in a little tension in
                    between, that strangeness of space creeping in. Then, something goes wrong in <em>Breach</em>, the
                    mission collapses and communication breaks down. <em>Lost Signal</em> then has the vibe of being
                    stranded in space, everyone else millions of miles away. Finally, <em>Detach</em> closes it all with
                    sacrifice: one person letting go, so the other can survive.</p>
                <p class="modal-note">It’s a narrative, but the songs also stand on their own. Each track has a distinct
                    personality, its own sound design, but together they tell this cinematic arc. I wanted it to feel
                    like a continuous piece, something you could just close your eyes to and drift away with.</p>

                <h3 class="modal-section-title">Production</h3>
                <p class="modal-note">If there’s one thing this project taught me, it’s to get way more creative with
                    synths. Every track has some unique element, a texture or sound, that makes it stand out. Compared
                    to my vocal albums, this was pure experimentation: I wasn’t worried about structure as much, I was
                    just doing what felt right. The hardest part was probably <em>Detach</em>. I had this idea of a
                    really emotional, interstellar-like ending, but I just couldn’t make it sound right. It took a while
                    to get there, but once I did, everything clicked.</p>
                <p class="modal-note">Overall, I was really pushing myself to make something that felt big and
                    cinematic. I wanted the production to match the scope of the story, and I think I got pretty close.
                </p>

                <h3 class="modal-section-title">Looking Back</h3>
                <p class="modal-note">I see <em>Spacewalk</em> as a turning point. It showed me I could make electronic
                    music that actually worked, and it gave me confidence with sound design in a way my vocal albums
                    didn’t. If there’s one thing I’d change, it’s the reliance on drum loops. I still haven’t dug into
                    making the drums myself, which is definitely a bit lazy. But honestly, if it helps me realize the
                    vision of the song, and it sounds good – why not use them?</p>
                <p class="modal-note">Even though it came out so close to <em>Born For More</em>, and I didn’t really do
                    any promo for it, I don’t regret releasing it. It’s its own universe, a cinematic little voyage, and
                    it captures exactly what I wanted: that feeling of drifting through space, somewhere between wonder
                    and loneliness.</p>
